# Twig Go to Definition - Version 0.0.7 Release Summary

## 🚀 Major Quality of Life Improvements Implemented

### ✅ **1. Smart Autocomplete Filtering**
**What it does**: Filters template suggestions as you type with fuzzy matching
**Example**: Typing "sec" shows "section-footer.twig", "section-header.twig"
**Benefit**: Much faster template discovery and selection
**Usage**: Just start typing in `{% include "` or `{% extends "`

### ✅ **2. Find All References**
**What it does**: Shows all places where templates, blocks, or variables are used
**Example**: Right-click on "base.twig" → "Find All References" → shows everywhere it's extended
**Benefit**: Essential for refactoring and understanding dependencies
**Usage**: Right-click on any template name, block name, or variable → "Find All References"

### ✅ **3. Template Outline View**
**What it does**: Shows template structure in VS Code's outline panel
**Example**: Displays organized view of blocks, includes, variables, and inheritance
**Benefit**: Quick navigation within large templates
**Usage**: Automatically appears in VS Code's outline panel when viewing .twig files

### ✅ **4. Enhanced Completion Scoring**
**What it does**: Better sorting of autocomplete suggestions based on relevance
**Example**: Exact matches appear first, fuzzy matches later
**Benefit**: Most relevant suggestions always at the top
**Usage**: Automatic - just use autocomplete normally

### ✅ **5. Improved Reference Detection**
**What it does**: More accurate finding of template and block references
**Example**: Finds all includes, extends, and block usages across the project
**Benefit**: More reliable navigation and search
**Usage**: Automatic background improvement

## 🎯 How These Features Work Together

### **Enhanced Developer Workflow**:
1. **Start typing** a template name → **Smart filtering** shows relevant options
2. **Navigate** to a template → **Outline view** shows its structure immediately
3. **Need to refactor?** → **Find All References** shows every usage
4. **Want to understand inheritance?** → **Outline** shows extends relationships

### **Before vs After**:

**Before (v0.0.6)**:
- Autocomplete showed all templates (overwhelming)
- No way to find all usages of a template
- No overview of template structure
- Basic navigation only

**After (v0.0.7)**:
- ✅ Autocomplete filters as you type (faster)
- ✅ Find all usages with right-click (safer refactoring)
- ✅ Template structure visible in outline (better understanding)
- ✅ Smarter suggestion ranking (more relevant results)

## 🧪 Testing the New Features

### **1. Test Smart Autocomplete**:
```twig
{% include "sec → should filter to show section-*.twig files
{% extends "ba → should show base.twig at top
```

### **2. Test Find All References**:
```twig
Right-click on "base.twig" anywhere → Find All References
Should show:
- All {% extends "base.twig" %} statements
- The base.twig file itself
```

### **3. Test Template Outline**:
```twig
Open any .twig file → Check outline panel (usually on right side)
Should show:
📁 Extends (if any)
📁 Blocks
📁 Includes
📁 Variables
```
