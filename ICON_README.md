# Icon Placeholder

Since I cannot create actual image files, you'll need to create a 128x128 PNG icon named `icon.png` in the root directory.

Suggested icon design:
- Twig logo or stylized "T" 
- Arrow or navigation symbol (â†’)
- Blue/green color scheme
- 128x128 pixels
- PNG format

You can create this using any image editor or find a suitable icon online.
Alternatively, remove the "icon" field from package.json if you prefer not to include an icon.
